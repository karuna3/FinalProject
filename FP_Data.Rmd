## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}


data<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\karun\\Desktop\\goose_rawdata.csv")

# Source of data is https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/goose

# I chose the data set as it has required size and other requirements that have been mentioned in the problem statement

library(dplyr)

data%>%group_by(team)%>%summarize(AverageBrokenEggs=mean(broken_eggs,na.rm = TRUE))

#In the above code we populate the average broken eggs by each team

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
